# Network Accessible Storage

## About Project
<p align="justify">Storage space is a primary requirement for the vast amount of data present in today’s world. Not
just storage, but ’mobile’ storage, which means that it should reliably accessible from anywhere, is not a luxury but has become a necessity. So to mitigate this problem, we aim to introduce a low cost and a simple solution in the form of Network Accessible Storage. It basically allows anyone with a spare usb storage device like a hard drive to connect the storage to the internet and use the drive as a personal cloud, which is accessible from anywhere over the internet. This
provides a cost effective solution for storing information and accessing it when required. The main aim of this project is to make our external storage devices act as a personal cloud so that we can access data from them at the important time when the device is not with us.</p>
